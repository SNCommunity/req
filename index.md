## Intro

If you want to be in the Arcade Fighters game, you will need to put in a lot of work, as it's an actual fighting game which needs a lot.

### Note also, all that is mentioned should be put into 1 Stick Nodes project (as movieclips, including textures/icons mentioned below), so our sprite creators can harvest what we need out of them.

We will split into two parts, [Icons/Textures](https://sncommunity.github.io/req/pages/icons-and-textures) and [Sprites](https://sncommunity.github.io/req/pages/sprites).

# Required super animations

### When making supers, in your project, make an animation sequence for each super level. They should only use Movieclips and be used on your own fighter in the project file, so we can recreate it in the game.

❗ For supers, you can have unique animations, but they must be movieclips named "Super" or something similar and easy to find.
When you send a project file, it should have: Your movie clip library (Duh), and an animation of each super like in each gif (click the corresponding super hyperlink to see the gifs).

the higher the super level, the higher the complexity and length

<ol>
  <li><a href="./supers/super1">Super 1</a></li> <!-- <a href="./supers/super1"> </a> -->
  <li><a href="./supers/super2">Super 2</a></li> <!-- <a href="./supers/super2"> </a> -->
  <li><a href="./supers/super3">Super 3</a></li> <!-- <a href="./supers/super3"> </a> -->
</ol>

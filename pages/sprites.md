# Arcade Fighters Game Sprite Requirements

## For Sprites, you will need to make a number of required movieclip animations:

### Additional moves are allowed, but only if they are fair, and they must be explained in the project file so we can decide if the move is acceptable.
Examples of acceptable additional moves: 
- Pros: character can fly, Cons: using it too long will make the character fall to the ground and be vulnerable
- Pros: character can do a high jump if they press down before jumping, Cons: can't block mid air
- Forward special has a crouching variant
- etc.

### NOTE
- Specials and Normals will be based on directional input e.g Up Special, Downward Special, Forward Special, Neutral Special, (see Brawlhalla or super smashbros' specials)
- No flashing red, post FX will be added in-game
- 4 buttons. Light, medium, heavy, and special. I normally donâ€™t prefer button specials, but button specials are more beginner friendly for people who have difficulty with motion inputs

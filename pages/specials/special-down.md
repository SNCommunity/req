# Special down

## The game ain't Super Smash Bros, it won't be a platformer. Your down special shouldn't be directly down. You can have it like that, but it will rarely be used that way.

### The game is like this:
![example of what Arcade Fighters is; screenshot of Street Fighter](https://sncommunity.github.io/req/assets/images/this.png)  
But bigger and more spacious

### Not this:
![example of what Arcade Fighters is NOT; screenshot of Super Smash Bros](https://sncommunity.github.io/req/assets/images/not-this.png) 

### Good example of a special (down special is on the right):

Down special casts a sphere that, if caught in it, stops time.

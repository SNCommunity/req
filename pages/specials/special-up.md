# Special up

## The game ain't Super Smash Bros, it won't be a platformer. Your up special shouldn't be directly up. You can have it like that, but it will rarely be used that way. Up special should be diagonally forward or even forward if you want your character to be special or sumfin.

### The game is like this:

But bigger and more spacious

### Not this:

### Good example of a special (up special is on the left):

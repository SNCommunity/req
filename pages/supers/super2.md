# Super 2

### Level 2 or “EX” supers are sometimes a different super, or an even MORE powerful version of the last super. This type of super is usually referred to as a “Hyper combo” which consists of your fighter landing a single strike to activate, and then automatically comboing your opponent at rapid rates.

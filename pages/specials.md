## ⚠️ Any clickable hyperlinks have additional important information

# Required special animations

### Specials will be based on directional input e.g Upward Special, Downward Special, Forward Special, Neutral Special, (see Brawlhalla or super smashbros' specials)

*Can have more for different states, "states" being Crouching, Air, and Blocking, but don't do it.*

<ol>
  <li><a href="./specials/special-up">Upwards (shouldn't be directly up, you can have it like that, but it will rarely be used that way, up special should be diagonally forward or even forward if you want your character to be special or sumfin)</a></li> <!-- <a href="./specials/special-up"> </a> -->
  <li><a href="./specials/special-down">Downward (same as upward)</a></li> <!-- <a href="./specials/special-down"> </a> -->
  <li>Neutral</li> <!-- <a href="./specials/special-neutral"> </a> -->
  <li>Forward</li> <!-- <a href="./specials/special-forward"> </a> -->
  <li>Backwards (Optional)</li> <!-- <a href="./specials/special-backward"> </a> -->
